# 🛍️ Customer Segmentation with K-Means Clustering

## 📌 Project Description
This project aims to segment mall customers based on their **Annual Income** and **Spending Score** using the **K-Means Clustering** algorithm.  
Customer segmentation helps businesses better understand their clients and design targeted marketing strategies.

---

## 📂 Dataset
- **Mall_Customers.csv**  
- Columns:  
  - `CustomerID`: Unique customer ID  
  - `Genre`: Gender  
  - `Age`: Age of the customer  
  - `Annual Income (k$)`: Annual income in thousands of dollars  
  - `Spending Score (1-100)`: Spending score assigned by the mall  

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python 🐍  
- **Libraries:**  
  - Data Analysis: Pandas, NumPy  
  - Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn  
  - Machine Learning: Scikit-learn (KMeans, preprocessing)  

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis
- Gender distribution (bar chart)  
- Age distribution (histogram with average age line)  
- Scatter plot: Annual Income vs Spending Score  
- Correlation analysis between features  

---

## 🚀 Steps
1. Load and explore the dataset  
2. Perform data cleaning and descriptive statistics  
3. Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations  
4. Apply **K-Means Clustering** on Annual Income and Spending Score  
5. Visualize the resulting clusters and centroids  

---

## 📌 Results
- Average age, income, and spending score calculated  
- Correlation between annual income and spending score analyzed  
- **5 customer clusters** created with K-Means and visualized
